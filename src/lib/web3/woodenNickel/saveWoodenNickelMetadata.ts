    With this Wooden Nickel you can forge the Fake ID youâ€™ll need for your voyage into the Hellbenders Slipstream.

The first Wooden Nickel was issued in 1933 by the town of Blaine, Washington as a real currency when their bank failed during the Great Depression. Many other towns followed suit until the U.S. Congress outlawed wooden currency just a few years later.

The Hellbenders Motorcycle Club honors each member as a sovereign soul with the inalienable right to mint their own currency. 

This Wooden Nickel was minted by ${name} as legal tender in the Slipstream.
